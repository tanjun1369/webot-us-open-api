# Webot US Institution Open API Documentation (v2)

HTTP API reference for institutional service providers (`/api/v2/institution/*`). An institution uses **its own API Key (an RSA or Ed25519 key pair)** to onboard and operate the sub-accounts (`userId`) bound to it — fiat deposit/withdrawal, stablecoin conversion, on-chain assets, and trading-account balances.

> This is the **v2** institution reference. Unlike v1 ([webot-institution-openapi.md](./webot-institution-openapi.md)), v2 uses **public-key signature authentication** (RSA or Ed25519) and identifies the target sub-account by **`userId`** (a UUID) rather than `uid`. Authentication is documented in full below — v2 does **not** share the v1 authentication section.

## General Information

| | |
|---|---|
| Base URL | `https://api.webot.com` |
| Protocol | HTTPS |
| Data Format | JSON |
| Field Naming | camelCase (e.g. `userId`, `clientOrderId`) |
| Amounts | decimal strings (e.g. `"100.50"`) — never float, never minor-unit integers |
| Timestamps | millisecond Unix timestamp (`int64`) in **response bodies**; the signature `timestamp` query parameter is in **seconds** (see Authentication) |
| Currency codes | ISO 4217 uppercase (`"USD"`); country codes ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 uppercase (`"US"`) |

### Response Envelope

All endpoints return a uniform envelope.

**Success:**

```json
{ "result": true, "timestamp": 1785706000000, "data": { } }
```

**Failure:**

```json
{ "result": false, "timestamp": 1785706000000, "code": "P_PAY_OPEN_API_INVALID_ARGUMENT", "message": "..." }
```

Business failures are returned as HTTP `200` with `result: false`. The only two exceptions come from the authentication layer: `401` (authentication failed) and `400` (request body could not be read).

## Authentication

Every request (except where noted) is authenticated with your institution API Key and a **signature**. Apply for an API Key by registering your **public key** with Webot; you keep the private key.

### Headers

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `X-APIKEY` | Your API Key, in the form `webot_xxxxxxxx`. Used to look up your registered public key. |
| `X-Signature` | Base64 (standard encoding) of the signature over the canonical string below. |

### Signature algorithms

The algorithm is determined by the **type of public key you registered** — you do not choose it per request. Two key types are supported:

| Key type | How to sign | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **RSA** | RSA-PSS over the **SHA-256** digest | 2048–4096-bit key. Salt length 32 recommended (20 / 32 / 64 all accepted). **Not** PKCS#1 v1.5. |
| **Ed25519** | Sign the message bytes **directly** | Do **not** pre-hash — EdDSA already includes SHA-512. |

- Register the public key in **PKIX/SPKI** form (`-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----`). PKCS#1 "RSA PUBLIC KEY" and other algorithms (ECDSA, DSA, …) are not accepted.
- RSA reference: Go `rsa.SignPSS(rand, priv, crypto.SHA256, sha256(msg), nil)`; OpenSSL `-sigopt rsa_padding_mode:pss`.

### Required query parameter

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `timestamp` | integer | Current time in **seconds** (Unix). Required on every signed request and participates in the signature. Must be within **±5 seconds** of server time, otherwise the request is rejected. |

> `timestamp` goes in the **query string** on every request, including `POST` (whose business payload is in the JSON body). There is **no** `client_id` / nonce parameter.

### Canonical string

Sign the following string:

```
{sub_path}:{sorted_query_string}:{request_body}:{timestamp}
```

| Segment | Construction |
|---------|--------------|
| `sub_path` | The request path, verbatim (not URL-encoded), e.g. `/api/v2/institution/account/balances`. |
| `sorted_query_string` | Percent-encode each key and value **separately** with `encodeURIComponent` semantics — do **not** escape `A-Za-z0-9 - _ . ! ~ * ' ( )`, hex digits uppercase, space is `%20` (do not use form-encoding, which emits `+`). Join each as `key=value`, then **sort the `key=value` strings** and join with `&`. Every query parameter participates — `timestamp` plus business params such as `userId`; repeated keys are kept and sorted by value. |
| `request_body` | For `POST` with a JSON body: the raw body, verbatim (not re-serialized). For `GET`: the empty string (so the canonical string shows `::`). |
| `timestamp` | The same seconds value, appended again at the end. |

**Examples:**

```
GET  (no body):   /api/v2/institution/account/balances:timestamp=1785706000&userId=88001234::1785706000
POST (JSON body): /api/v2/institution/kyb/create:timestamp=1785706000:{"userId":"88001234"}:1785706000
```

Then `X-Signature = base64( sign( canonical_string ) )`, sent together with `X-APIKEY`.

---

## Permissions (Scopes)

Each API Key is granted one or more **scopes** at registration (default: `read`). Every endpoint requires a scope; a request whose key lacks the required scope is rejected with `P_PAY_OPEN_API_PERMISSION_DENIED` and never reaches business logic.

- **Read** endpoints (the `GET` queries — balances, orders, records, requirements, status, lists) require read access.
- **State-changing** endpoints (`POST` create / submit / update / delete — sub-account and KYB onboarding, payouts, on-chain withdrawals, conversions, address-book and file writes) require the corresponding **write** scope.

Contact Webot to grant your key the scopes your integration needs; the scopes attached to a key cannot be changed by the caller.

---

## The `userId` Parameter

Except for public/self endpoints (create user, list users, `asset/currencies`), **every endpoint requires `userId`** — the UUID of the target sub-account:

- **GET requests:** pass `userId` in the query string (it participates in the signature);
- **POST requests with a JSON body:** pass `userId` in the JSON request body;
- **File upload** (`multipart/form-data`): pass `userId` in the query string.

Obtain `userId` values from [List Sub-Accounts](#2-list-sub-accounts) (or the response of [Create Sub-Account](#1-create-sub-account)).

---

## Error Codes

Codes below may be returned by any endpoint (base set). Endpoint-specific business codes are listed with the relevant endpoint.

| Error Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `P_PAY_OPEN_API_INVALID_ARGUMENT` | A request parameter is missing or invalid. |
| `P_PAY_OPEN_API_UNAUTHENTICATED` | Authentication failed (missing key, bad signature, etc.). Returns HTTP `401`. |
| `P_PAY_OPEN_API_PERMISSION_DENIED` | Your API Key lacks permission for this endpoint. |
| `P_PAY_OPEN_API_NOT_FOUND` | Resource does not exist, or does not belong to this user. |
| `P_PAY_OPEN_API_ALREADY_EXISTS` | Resource already exists (e.g. address already in the address book). |
| `P_PAY_OPEN_API_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | A dependency is temporarily unavailable; retry later. |
| `P_PAY_OPEN_API_TIMEOUT` | The request timed out; retry later. |
| `P_PAY_OPEN_API_INTERNAL_ERROR` | Internal error. |

---

## User Endpoints

### 1. Create Sub-Account

Create a sub-account (user) bound to your institution. Idempotent by `clientId`.

```
POST /api/v2/institution/user/create
```

**Request Body (JSON):**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| clientId | string | Yes | Client-defined idempotency key, max 64 chars. Retries must reuse the same value. |
| email | string | Yes | Email, max 64 chars. |
| entityType | string | Yes | `CORPORATE` (business) / `INDIVIDUAL` (natural person). |
| remark | string | No | Note, max 100 chars. |

**Response Example:**

```json
{ "result": true, "timestamp": 1785706000000, "data": { "userId": "88001234-1a2b-..." } }
```

**Errors:**

| Error Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `P_PAY_OPEN_API_SUB_USER_CREATE_FORBIDDEN` | Master account unavailable, caller is itself a sub-account (nesting unsupported), or sub-account limit reached. |
| `P_PAY_OPEN_API_SUB_USER_ACCOUNT_CREATE_FAILED` | The sub-account was created but not fully set up. `data.userId` returns the created id; resend the identical request to complete setup. |

### 2. List Sub-Accounts

```
GET /api/v2/institution/users
```

**Request Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| page | integer | No | Page number, starting from 1. |
| size | integer | No | Page size, default 100, max 500. |

**Response Example:**

```json
{
  "result": true,
  "timestamp": 1785706000000,
  "data": {
    "list": [
      { "userId": "88001234-...", "email": "a@example.com", "entityType": "CORPORATE", "status": "ACTIVE", "remark": "Client A", "createTime": 1785700000000 }
    ],
    "total": 1
  }
}
```

> `total` is the total count for pagination. An out-of-range page returns an empty `list` with the real `total`.

---

## KYB Endpoints

Onboarding is a **two-step** flow:

1. **Platform KYB** — submit company/representative information once via `POST /kyb/create`. It must reach status `APPROVED` before any channel deposit onboarding.
2. **Channel onboarding** — once platform KYB is approved, onboard a deposit account with a specific channel via `wire/deposit/account/*`.

> **Precondition:** all `wire/*` endpoints (channel deposit onboarding, deposit accounts/orders, payout accounts, payouts) require the `userId`'s **platform KYB to be `APPROVED`**. Otherwise `P_PAY_OPEN_API_INTERNAL_KYB_NOT_APPROVED` is returned.

### How to fill KYB fields

Platform KYB and channel KYB use **different** field sources — fill them accordingly.

#### Platform KYB fields (`POST /kyb/create`)

Platform KYB fields follow a **fixed, documented field list** — fill them according to this documentation, not by calling an endpoint. Every item has a **canonical key** in a flat key space:

- Subject (company) fields use the `subject.` prefix; each is one `{ "key": "...", "value": "..." }` under `subject.fields`.
- Each related natural person uses the `representative.` prefix; submit one entry per person under `representatives[]`, distinguished by the `representativeRef` property.
- Documents share the same key space (their key is the document's purpose) and carry a `fileId` — upload first (see [File Endpoints](#file-endpoints)), then reference by `fileId`.

The complete field list, required markers, formats, conditional rules, enums, and the document matrix are in **[Platform KYB Field Reference](#platform-kyb-field-reference)** below.

#### Channel KYB fields (`wire/deposit/account/*`)

> **`channel` currently supports only `bridge`.**

Channel KYB fields are **dynamic** — **call `GET /wire/deposit/account/requirements` first**, then fill per the returned `Requirement` items. Do not hard-code channel field lists.

- **`mode`** tells you whether an item is `REQUIRED`, `OPTIONAL`, or `CONDITIONAL`.
- **`CONDITIONAL`** items carry a `condition` (an `ALL`/`ANY` set of predicates over other fields) describing when the item becomes required. Evaluating to `false` means "not currently required"; the final decision rests with the channel.
- **`kind`** is `FIELD` or `DOCUMENT`. Documents are referenced by `fileId` (upload first — see [File Endpoints](#file-endpoints)); do not inline file bytes.
- Representatives are grouped by `representativeRef`; fill each representative's own `fields` / `documents`.
- `regex` / `example` / `enumValues` on a field are for client-side validation and hints.
- The requirements endpoint returns the items still required for the selected channel; information already provided is omitted. **Documents must be submitted in full.**

> The exact fields and documents each channel requires — with their formats — are returned by the requirements endpoint. Render your form from that response rather than hard-coding a list.

### 1. Submit Platform KYB

```
POST /api/v2/institution/kyb/create
```

**Request Body (JSON):**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| userId | string | Yes | Sub-account UUID. A `userId` has a single platform KYB application; resubmitting updates it. |
| subject | object | No | Subject fields: `{ "fields": [ { "key": "...", "value": "..." } ] }`. Keys are canonical keys. |
| representatives | object[] | No | Each: `{ "representativeRef": "...", "fields": [ ... ] }`. |
| documents | object[] | No | Each: `{ "purpose": "...", "fileId": "...", "scope": "SUBJECT|REPRESENTATIVE", "representativeRef": "..." }`. |

**Response Example:**

```json
{ "result": true, "timestamp": 1785706000000, "data": { "status": "SUBMITTED" } }
```

Validation (key validity + unconditional required + enum) passing returns `SUBMITTED`; otherwise `P_PAY_OPEN_API_INVALID_ARGUMENT` and nothing is stored.

### 2. Get Platform KYB Status

```
GET /api/v2/institution/kyb
```

**Request Parameters:** `userId` (string, required).

**Response Example:**

```json
{ "result": true, "timestamp": 1785706000000, "data": { "status": "APPROVED", "reason": "", "message": "" } }
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| status | string | `SUBMITTED` / `PENDING` / `SUPPLEMENT_REQUIRED` / `APPROVED` / `REJECTED`. |
| reason | string | Review conclusion code; empty before review. |
| message | string | Conclusion description; empty before review. |

### 3. Get Channel Onboarding Requirements

Returns the items still required for channel onboarding. Information already provided is omitted. Representative requirements are returned per contact.

```
GET /api/v2/institution/wire/deposit/account/requirements
```

**Request Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| userId | string | Yes | Sub-account UUID. |
| channel | string | Yes | Channel identifier. Currently only `bridge` is supported. |

> Do not pass `country` or `businessType` — the requirement set follows the values from your platform KYB (`subject.country` / `subject.businessType`).

**Response Fields (`data`):**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| subjectFields | Requirement[] | Subject fields still missing (what your platform KYB has not already provided). |
| subjectDocuments | Requirement[] | Subject documents still missing (flattened, one per purpose). |
| requiresRepresentatives | boolean | Whether representative info is required. |
| representatives | object[] | What each contact still needs, one entry per contact: `{ representativeRef, fields[], documents[] }`. Contacts already on file are returned **with their `representativeRef`** — reuse that value when submitting. If there is no contact yet, a single entry with an empty `representativeRef` and the full template is returned, to fill in your first contact. |
| fileLimit | object | `{ maxFileCount, maxFileBytes, maxTotalBytes, contentTypes[] }`. |
| tosMode | string | `NONE` / `HOSTED_LINK` / `INLINE_ACCEPT`. |
| tosUrl | string | Terms URL; empty when `NONE`. |
| termsVersion | string | Terms version; non-empty only for `INLINE_ACCEPT`. |
| requiresBusinessType | boolean | Whether a business type is still needed to refine the list. Always `false` in this API — the business type comes from platform KYB. |

`Requirement`: `{ key, kind (FIELD|DOCUMENT), mode (REQUIRED|OPTIONAL|CONDITIONAL), label, regex, example, enumValues[], condition }`.

### 4. Onboard a Deposit Account (Channel KYB)

Submit channel onboarding. Returns onboarding `status` only; missing/invalid items are not itemized — call the requirements endpoint to learn what is still missing.

```
POST /api/v2/institution/wire/deposit/account/create
```

**Request Body (JSON):**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| userId | string | Yes | Sub-account UUID. |
| channel | string | No | Channel. Currently only `bridge` is supported. |
| signedAgreementId | string | Cond. | For `tosMode = HOSTED_LINK`. |
| acceptedTerms | boolean | Cond. | For `tosMode = INLINE_ACCEPT`. |
| termsVersion | string | Cond. | For `tosMode = INLINE_ACCEPT`. |
| subject | object | No | `{ "fields": [ { "key", "value" } ] }`. |
| representatives | object[] | No | `[ { "representativeRef", "fields": [...] } ]`. |
| documents | object[] | No | **Provide all required documents in full every time.** Each: `{ purpose, fileId, scope, representativeRef }`. |

> Do not pass `country` or `businessType` here either — they come from your platform KYB. Any `fileId` you reference must belong to this `userId`.

**Response Example:**

```json
{ "result": true, "timestamp": 1785706000000, "data": { "status": "IN_REVIEW" } }
```

`status`: `NOT_CREATED` / `SUBMITTED` / `IN_REVIEW` / `ACTION_REQUIRED` / `APPROVED` / `REJECTED`.

**Errors:**

| Error Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `P_PAY_OPEN_API_INTERNAL_KYB_NOT_APPROVED` | Platform KYB is not approved yet; it must be approved before channel onboarding. |
| `P_PAY_OPEN_API_KYB_ADDRESS_REJECTED` | Address rejected by the channel; `data.violations` names the rejected fields. |
| `P_PAY_OPEN_API_KYB_DOCUMENT_REJECTED` | A document was rejected or a required field is missing. |
| `P_PAY_OPEN_API_KYB_SUBJECT_TYPE_CONFLICT` | Another subject type already exists for this `userId`. |
| `P_PAY_OPEN_API_KYB_MANUAL_REVIEW_REQUIRED` | Additional review is required; do not resubmit with altered details. |
| `P_PAY_OPEN_API_KYB_SUBJECT_NOT_FOUND` | No matching company record was found. |

### 5. Get Deposit-Account Onboarding Status

```
GET /api/v2/institution/wire/deposit/account
```

**Request Parameters:** `channel` (string, required; currently only `bridge` is supported). `status = NOT_CREATED` means not yet onboarded (not an error). Response `data`: `{ "status": "..." }` (same enum as above).

## Platform KYB Field Reference

The canonical fields and documents accepted by `POST /kyb/create`. Applies to companies registered in **Hong Kong (HK)** or the **United States (US)**.

### Required markers

| Marker | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **M** | Mandatory — a missing value fails validation (`P_PAY_OPEN_API_INVALID_ARGUMENT`). |
| **C** | Conditional — required when the trigger in the description holds. |
| **O** | Optional — providing it speeds up review; omitting it does not block. |

> The `HK` / `US` columns give the marker per jurisdiction (`subject.country`). `N/A` means the field is ignored for that jurisdiction. Files are submitted as `documents[]` with the document's canonical key as `purpose` and a `fileId`.

### Submission structure

```json
{
  "userId": "88001234-....",
  "subject": { "fields": [ { "key": "subject.legalNameEn", "value": "Acme Ltd." }, ... ] },

| `subject.einConfirmationLetter` | N/A | M | IRS EIN confirmation letter (CP575 / 147C). |
| `subject.bylaws` | N/A | C | Charter — when `businessType` is a corporation subtype (`B_CORPORATION` / `C_CORPORATION` / `CLOSE_CORPORATION` / `S_CORPORATION`). **Note 4**. |
| `subject.operatingAgreement` | N/A | C | Charter — when `businessType = LLC`, or the merged fallback when `businessType` is not provided. **Note 4**. |
| `subject.partnershipAgreement` | N/A | C | Charter — when `businessType = LLP` / `LP` / `GENERAL_PARTNERSHIP`. **Note 4**. |
| `subject.registerOfDirectors` | C | C | Register of directors. **Note 2**. |
| `subject.ownershipProof` | C | C | Register of shareholders. **Note 2**. |
| `subject.shareholdingStructureChart` | C | C | Shareholding structure chart. **Note 2, Note 3**. |

| `subject.addressProofOther` | O | O | Address proof: other. |

**Conditional rules:**

- **Note 1 (HK charter docs):** submit at least one of `incorporationFormNnc1` / `annualReturnNar1`. If incorporated over a year, `annualReturnNar1` (latest directors/shareholders/address) is preferred.
- **Note 2 (ownership & directors):** submit at least one of `registerOfDirectors` / `ownershipProof` / `shareholdingStructureChart` that fully shows directors and ownership. If already evidenced by NNC1/NAR1 (HK) or the charter document (US), it may be omitted, and `subject.ownershipDeclaration.*` may then also be omitted.
- **Note 3:** if none of the above shows the full ownership chain (e.g. multi-tier holding), `shareholdingStructureChart` will be requested via supplement.
- **Note 4 (US charter):** submit the charter document matching `businessType` — corporation subtypes (`B_CORPORATION` / `C_CORPORATION` / `CLOSE_CORPORATION` / `S_CORPORATION`) → `bylaws`; `LLC` → `operatingAgreement`; `LLP` / `LP` / `GENERAL_PARTNERSHIP` → `partnershipAgreement`. Only one, matching the true org form. (`operatingAgreement` also serves as the fallback when the specific charter type is unclear.)
- **Note 5 (source of funds):** mandatory. Acceptable forms include recent 6-month corporate bank statements, audited financials, key trade contracts + invoices, capital-contribution proof, or investment agreements + receipts. Multiple entries allowed (at least one). An account-balance screenshot alone is insufficient — the funds' formation chain must be shown.

**Address proof:** required when `operatingAddressSameAsRegistered = false`, or when the submitted registration documents do not state an address. Provide via the `subject.bankStatement` / `utilityBill` / `leaseAgreement` / `taxNotice` / `addressProofOther` keys; issued within the last 3 months.

### 3. Representative fields (`representative.*`)

One set per person, distinguished by the `representativeRef` property (see [Submission structure](#submission-structure)). Note: the per-person id is the `representativeRef` property of each `representatives[]` entry, **not** a `fields[]` key.

| Key | HK | US | Rules |
|-----|:--:|:--:|-------|
| `representativeRef` *(property — not a `fields[]` key)* | M | M | Stable per-person id in your system; keep unchanged across supplements. Supplied as the `representativeRef` property of each `representatives[]` entry (see [Submission structure](#submission-structure)) — do **not** place it inside `fields`. `subject.signerPersonRefId` references this value. |
| `representative.role.responsibility` | O | O | The person's responsibility relative to the company — **single value** from the enum (§[Enums](#5-enums)): `ULTIMATE_BENEFICIAL_OWNER` / `AUTHORIZED_REPRESENTATIVE` / `DIRECTOR`. |
| `representative.firstName` | M | M | English first name, ≤100. Must match the ID exactly. |
| `representative.middleName` | O | O | English middle name, ≤100. Provide if present on the ID. |
| `representative.lastName` | M | M | English last name, ≤100. Must match the ID exactly. |
| `representative.fullNameCn` | O | N/A | Chinese name, ≤50. HK: provide if the ID carries a Chinese name. |
| `representative.jobTitle` | M | M | Title (e.g. Director, CEO), ≤100. |
| `representative.birthDate` | M | M | `yyyy-MM-dd`. Must match the ID; must be ≥ 18 years old. |
| `representative.nationality` | M | M | ISO 3166-1 alpha-2. |
| `representative.ownershipPercentage` | C | C | Required when `role.responsibility = ULTIMATE_BENEFICIAL_OWNER`. `0.01`–`100`, ≤2 decimals; look-through actual percentage. |
| `representative.residentialAddress.addressLine1` | M | M | Actual residential address (not temporary), ≤200. |
| `representative.residentialAddress.addressLine2` | O | O | ≤200. |
| `representative.residentialAddress.city` | M | M | ≤100. |
| `representative.residentialAddress.state` | O | M | US mandatory (2-letter state code). |
| `representative.residentialAddress.postalCode` | O | M | US mandatory. |
| `representative.residentialAddress.countryCode` | M | M | ISO 3166-1 alpha-2. |
| `representative.email` | M | M | Required for every person, ≤128 (used for verification-code delivery). |
| `representative.phone.countryCode` | O | O | Recommended for the primary contact person. |
| `representative.phone.number` | O | O | Recommended for the primary contact person. |
| `representative.identityDocument.ssn` | N/A | M | US: personal tax id (SSN/ITIN) for every person; N/A for HK. |
| `representative.identityDocument.idType` | M | M | Enum §[Enums](#5-enums). |
| `representative.identityDocument.idNumber` | M | M | ≤64. |
| `representative.identityDocument.issuingCountry` | M | M | ISO 3166-1 alpha-2. |
| `representative.identityDocument.issueDate` | O | O | `yyyy-MM-dd`. |
| `representative.identityDocument.expiryDate` | M | M | `yyyy-MM-dd`. Long-validity IDs use `9999-12-31`. An already-expired ID fails validation. |
| `representative.ownershipAttestedAt` | C | C | ISO 8601. Required when `subject.ownershipDeclaration.hasShareholderOver25Percent` has a value. |

### 4. Representative documents (`representative.*`)

Value is a `fileId`. ID-document files are routed by `identityDocument.idType` (see the Role/ID enum below).

| Key | Req | Notes |
|-----|:--:|-------|
| `representative.passport` | C | Passport photo page (front only) — when `idType = PASSPORT`. |
| `representative.idCardFront` / `representative.idCardBack` | C | Both required for card-style IDs — see the idType routing note in §[Enums](#5-enums). |
| `representative.driversLicenseFront` / `representative.driversLicenseBack` | C | Both required when `idType = DRIVERS_LICENSE`. |
| `representative.taxIdDocument` | C | Tax-id proof (SSN / ITIN); provide together with `representative.identityDocument.ssn` for US persons. |
| `representative.proofOfAddress` | C | Required when the residential address differs from the ID's stated address. |
| `representative.photoHoldingId` | O | Requested by risk control when fraud is suspected. |
| `representative.liveSelfie` | O | As above. |
| `representative.appointmentDocument` | O | Appointment/authorization document. |
| `representative.nameChangeCertificate` | C | Required when the ID name differs from the declared name. |
| `representative.supportiveOther` | O | Other supporting materials. |

### 5. Enums

Values below are the exact accepted values. The subset actually allowed for a given channel/country is returned by the requirements flow — do not assume every value is accepted everywhere.

**`subject.country`**: `HK`, `US`.

**`subject.registrationNoType`**: `BRN` (HK), `EIN` (US).

**`subject.businessType`** (single list — not split by jurisdiction):
`B_CORPORATION`, `C_CORPORATION`, `CLOSE_CORPORATION`, `S_CORPORATION`, `LLC`, `LLP`, `LP`, `GENERAL_PARTNERSHIP`, `SOLE_PROPRIETOR`, `TRUST`, `COOPERATIVE`, `NONPROFIT_CORPORATION`, `OTHER`.

> `OTHER` requires an accompanying description. The subset offered per channel/country is returned by requirements.

**`subject.serviceAgreementType`**: `FULL` (direct service relationship), `RECIPIENT` (payee only, no direct relationship).

**`representative.role.responsibility`** (single value): `ULTIMATE_BENEFICIAL_OWNER`, `AUTHORIZED_REPRESENTATIVE`, `DIRECTOR`.

**`representative.identityDocument.idType`**: `PASSPORT`, `DRIVERS_LICENSE`, `NATIONAL_ID`, `STATE_OR_PROVINCIAL_ID`, `PERMANENT_RESIDENCY_ID`, `MATRICULATE_ID`, `MILITARY_ID`, `VISA`.

> **ID-document files by `idType`:** `PASSPORT` → `passport`; `DRIVERS_LICENSE` → `driversLicenseFront` + `driversLicenseBack`; all other government IDs (`NATIONAL_ID`, `STATE_OR_PROVINCIAL_ID`, `PERMANENT_RESIDENCY_ID`, `MATRICULATE_ID`, `MILITARY_ID`, `VISA`) → `idCardFront` + `idCardBack`.

**Address proof** (which `subject.*` document key to use): bank statement → `bankStatement`; utility bill → `utilityBill`; lease → `leaseAgreement`; tax notice → `taxNotice`; other → `addressProofOther`.

### 6. File limits

| Limit | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Max file count per submission | 30 |
| Max bytes per file | 12,582,912 (12 MB) |
| Max total bytes per submission | 104,857,600 (100 MB) |
| Allowed content types | `application/pdf`, `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, `image/heic` |

### 7. Role integrity & cross-field rules

Submission is rejected with `P_PAY_OPEN_API_INVALID_ARGUMENT` when any of the following fails:

- **Registration type matches jurisdiction:** `HK` ⇒ `registrationNoType = BRN`; `US` ⇒ `EIN`.
- **US state present:** `US` requires `subject.incorporationState`.
- **Operating address present** when `operatingAddressSameAsRegistered = false`.
- **Every representative has an `email`.**
- **Beneficial owner ownership:** when `subject.ownershipDeclaration.hasShareholderOver25Percent = true` (or an ownership document shows a ≥25% holder), at least one representative must have `role.responsibility = ULTIMATE_BENEFICIAL_OWNER`. Each such person's `ownershipPercentage` must be in `(0, 100]`, and the sum must not exceed 100.
- **ID not expired**; ID **back** file present for card-style IDs and `DRIVERS_LICENSE`.
- **Age ≥ 18** (from `birthDate`).
- **US charter document matches `businessType`** (see Note 4).
- **US personal tax id present** (`representative.identityDocument.ssn`) for every representative.
- **Required company documents present** per the matrix; source-of-funds proof present; ownership information resolvable (either an ownership document or `subject.ownershipDeclaration.*`).
- **Consents accepted:** `termsAgreed` and `dataUsageAgreed` are `true`.
